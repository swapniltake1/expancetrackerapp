# 💰 Expense Tracker App

A simple yet functional **Expense Tracker API** built with **Spring Boot**.  
This project is designed as part of my personal practice and learning journey in backend development.  
The application allows users to manage their expenses, set budgets, and filter expense records by date or category.


## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication** – Secure login and registration.
- **Expense Management** – Add, view, and filter expenses by date or category.
- **Budget Tracking** – Set or update monthly budgets.
- **Filter API** – Retrieve expenses based on time range or category.
- **Clean Code Structure** – Follows layered architecture with services, repositories, and DTOs.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Spring Security (JWT Authentication)**
- **Hibernate**
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** (configurable)
- **Lombok** for boilerplate reduction


## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/expense-tracker.git
   cd expense-tracker
   ````

2. **Configure the Database**

   * Update `application.properties` with your database credentials.

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/expense_tracker
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the APIs**

## 📌 Note

This is a **practice project** created to strengthen my Spring Boot, REST API, and backend architecture skills.
**Next Step** → I will integrate a **frontend** using React or Angular for a complete full-stack application experience.
